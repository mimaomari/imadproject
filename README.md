When you open the app, you're taken to the home screen, where meals are organized by time of day: Morning, Mid-Morning, Dinner, Afternoon and Mid-Afternoon. This makes it easy for users to quickly find what they want to eat depending on the time.
Each section displays a meal optios suitable for that time. For example, under Morning, users can find breakfast meal like a french toast. Afternoon offers a meal like a chicken wrap.
The navigation is simple and user-friendly. Users can tap into each category to see a meal or even instructions on how detailed the app is designed to be.
This app was created to make meal planning more convenient and structured, especially for users who want quick access to meal ideas throughoutout the day.
The home screen was designed to be clean and minimal, with clearly labeled sections and easy-to-read fonts and high-contrast colors were used to ensure readability for all users, including those with visual impairments. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both smartphones and tablets.  A straightforward layout with intuitive taps and scrolls allows users to move between meal categories without confusion. Each stage of development was documented through commits, allowing me to revert to previous versions when necessary.
